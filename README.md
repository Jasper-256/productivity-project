# Productivity Monitor

## Setup Instructions

1. Create the file `openai_api_key.txt` and put your OpenAI key there.
2. Install the required python packages by running these commands. You might need to use `pip3`, check your python versions or install python 3 if you don't have it.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. For macOS, use homebrew to install tesseract `brew install tesseract` (install homebrew if you do not have it). For windows, look up tesseract ocr and install it.
4. Run the python file by typing `python3 productivity.py` into your terminal.
